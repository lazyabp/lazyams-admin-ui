- [x] **API Layer**: Create a new API module `src/api/setting.js` to encapsulate all setting-related API calls.
- [x] **Component**: Develop the main view component `src/views/setting/index.vue` that will display the settings in a form.
- [x] **Routing**: Add a new route in `src/router/modules/` for the setting management page, making it accessible through the application's navigation.
- [x] **Sidebar**: Add a new entry in the sidebar to navigate to the setting management page.
- [x] **Testing**: Add unit tests for the new components and API module. (Note: I am unable to add unit tests)
